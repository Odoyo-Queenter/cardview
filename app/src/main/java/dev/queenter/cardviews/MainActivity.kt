The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).","10m","1.2m","6b")

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.","10m","1.2m","6b")

In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.","10m","1.2m","6b")

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?","10m","1.2m","6b")
